I recently had to read up a bit on some stochastic algorithms, and it felt like a slight throwback to the “Randomized and Approximation Algorithms” course in ASU that I took with Charles Colbourn – https://public.asu.edu/~ccolbou/.

It was one of the most intense and stimulating courses I have ever taken.

Colbourn was a total boss; he would just walk into the class many times empty-handed, with no notes nothing, ask one of us where he had left off and would start holding forth on the subject matter of the lecture and hold the whole class captivated.

The best part of his lectures was the flow of his thoughts, he could make even some pretty complex algorithms, and mathematical proofs seem simple and straightforward. The mastery of his subject, TCS and algorithms, was obvious once you attended his lecture.

The course had Rajeev Motwani’s “Randomized Algorithms” book as the course textbook but most of the real course material was the lecture and class notes, and it would be pretty hard to keep up with assignments and exams if you skipped the lectures.

His course was everything that I thought a grad-level course would be like – open-book tests, take-home exams, and assignments where no amount of ‘googling’ would help with the problems.

Though the problems were super tough, Colbourn was very approachable and would help you out if you visited him during his office hours.

I attended his course with 2 years of industry behind, so I was a bit rusty and felt the course was overwhelming in the beginning but was able to catch up and manage eventually.

Anyway, his course was not the one you would take to get good grades, but then if you are optimizing for grades, then you are doing grad school wrong.

Looks like Fall 2013 was the last time the course was offered – https://www.public.asu.edu/~ccolbou/.

That was the time I took the course, and I count myself lucky to have got a chance to take it with him. If you have studied computer science at ASU and have not taken his course, then I think you have missed something.

The other two teachers I remember are – Joohyung Lee and Jingrui He. Joohyung Lee taught ‘Knowledge Representation. It was a pretty theoretical course with a lot of logic programming, first-order logic and proofs, and so on.

Joohyung Lee had a very specific and different teaching philosophy that he described in his first class called “Teaching by Doing” – students were expected to work out problems on the whiteboard, in turns, during the class and later, the prof would discuss them.

My term paper for the course was to write a compiler of sorts that would compile a given OWL ontology into a set of first-order logic rules, which can then be used to run some interesting logical inference queries.

Joohyung Lee said that with a bit more work on the project, we might be able to get it published, but I got distracted by a bunch of other stuff after the course and never got around to doing it.

I did not take any course with Jingrui He, but TA’ed for her Machine Learning course, and I liked the experience and thought she was a good teacher.

This is not teacher’s day or anything, but I just remembered all this, and this is an appreciation thread for these teachers from [@SCAI_ASU](https://mobile.twitter.com/scai_asu) whom I would remember very positively – Charles Colbourn, Joohyung Lee, and Jingrui He.

_______________________________

It was sometime after Colbourn’s course and because of his course that I started participating in some online coding competitions. Eventually, in the Fall of 2014, I did well enough in some of the competitions that I got invited to a fully paid corporate networking event in San Jose. This was my first experience with such corporate events in the US and it felt pretty fancy back then.

I was flown over from Tempe to San Jose and put up in a fancy hotel, Hyatt Regency. They even booked a Limolink for me from the airport to the Hyatt Regency hotel. That was the first time I traveled in a limo car, and I didn’t even have to pretend that I was O’Brien, the way George and Jerry had to &#128512; –
