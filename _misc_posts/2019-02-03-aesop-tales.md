Aesop was a slave in ancient Greece and was a talented storyteller. His stories were passed down the generations not by writing but by a culture of people retelling the stories. The stories often contained wisdom and life lessons. Many years later, these stories were collected into a book called the “Fables of Aesop.”

These two stories from Aesop’s tales has been on my mind for the past couple of weeks –

### Thief and His Mother

Once a boy stole a lesson book from one of his schoolfellows and took it home and showed it to his mother. The mother, who doted on her son, did not reprimand him; instead, she praised him for being so clever and intelligent.

The boy next time stole a cloak and brought it to her, and she again praised him. She thought that even if thieving was wrong, her son was very young and was only being mischievous and that the habit would go away as time and age passed.

The boy advanced to adulthood, proceeded to steal things of greater and greater value, and performed heinous crimes. At last, he was caught by the authorities and put in jail. 

The mother was utterly heartbroken and thought the world had been unfair to her son. She went to jail to meet her son and thought her son would be delighted to see her. After all, hadn’t she always doted on him. 

In the jail, the son moved close to the bars of his cell and spat on her face. The mother was shocked to see this behavior from her son and scolded him. The son went on to say that if only she had reprimanded and corrected him when he performed the petty crimes in his youth, then he would have been saved from squandering his life in a jail cell.

### Ant and the Grasshopper

Once upon a time, in a field, on a warm summer’s day, a grasshopper was playing around, chirping and singing to its heart’s content.  A group of ants walked by, sweating and grunting as they were hard at work and struggled to carry big kernels of corn.

The grasshopper was amused on seeing them working so hard and asked them where they were carrying those heavy kernels. The ants replied that they were carrying these kernels to their anthills to store them in preparation for the coming winter. The grasshopper teased them that winter is so far away that the ants should join him in singing and enjoying this warm summer day. But the ants shook their head and went about their work.

Very soon, winter arrived, and the weather turned cold.  All the fields were covered with thick snow, and the grasshopper could not find any food. Soon the grasshopper found himself dying of hunger.

Weak and cold, he found his way to the ants’ hill and saw the ants comfortable in their anthill, well-fed from all the corn they had stored in the summer. He begged them for something to eat.

The ants asked him if he had not stored anything for the winter and what he did all summer. The grasshopper said that he hardly had time for storing food as he spent all his time singing and lazing around on the warm summer days. The ants shook their heads in exasperation, shut their door, and went on with their affairs.

**Note** – There are multiple versions of this story and multiple lessons that it offers, and they are all very interesting.

1. In the above story, the first lesson is, of course, that you should work hard and prepare for a rainy day like the ants did. The other lesson is – Were the ants being small-minded when they refused to help a grasshopper that was in dire need? Were they being selfish when they turned their back on the dying grasshopper? And was the grasshopper entitled to some form of help from the ants, whom he had earlier mocked?
2. The other version goes that as winter came, the grasshopper knew it had no food. So at the onset, it went to the anthill and stole all the food stored by the hardworking ants. The lesson in this story is that it is not enough to work hard, but you should also be wary of those who might steal the fruits of your labor.
