Once there was a king called Uttanapada. He had two wives – Sunithi and Surichi. Surichi was very beautiful but also very vain and condescending. Uttanapada favored Surichi because of her beauty, and this increased Surichi’s arrogance and sense of entitlement.

Sunithi’s son was Dhruva, and Surichi’s son was Uttama. Dhruva was the elder son, and as was the custom in those times, he was next in line for the throne. However, Surichi resented this and wanted her son to be the king. She used her influence over the king to ensure that Uttama was closer to the king than Dhruva.

One day, when Dhruva was seven years old, he saw Uttama sitting and playing on his father’s lap. He immediately ran to his father and tried to sit on the king’s lap himself. This angered Surichi, so she dragged Dhruva away from the king and shouted at him, saying that he does not deserve to sit on the king’s lap, that he would never be the king’s favorite, nor would Dhruva ever become the king, and that if he wanted to sit on the king’s lap, he should pray to Vishnu and request to be born as her son in his next birth.

Uttanapada was disturbed on seeing this but did not have the heart to stop it or say anything to his favorite wife. On witnessing his father’s silence at his ill-treatment, Dhruva was heartbroken and ran to his mother.

Dhruva narrated the entire incident to his mother and asked her why he was treated this way. Sunithi was disappointed and angry at the king for remaining silent at Surichi’s bad behavior, but she also knew that she was in no position to do anything about it. Instead, she tried to console Dhruva by explaining to him that Surichi is the king’s favorite queen and she wants to make sure that her son, though not next in lineage, should be the next king and that one day when Dhruva is older, he will understand why this is happening.

Looking at his mother’s solemn expression, Dhruva then goes on to ask who Vishnu is. Suniti says that Vishnu or Narayana, as he is also known, is the ultimate and most powerful god, and he is the protector of the whole universe. Dhruva got excited at these words and suggested to his mother that they should immediately go to him and seek solutions for all their problems. Suniti gives a sad smile and tells Dhruva that it is not easy to see Vishnu and that only those who can meditate on him with extreme focus get to see him.

Later after his mother went to sleep, her words and the other events of the day keep playing back in Dhruva’s mind. His mind is riddled with questions such as

- Why is his stepmother, Surichi, always so mean to him? Why does she not consider him also as her son? Didn’t his teachers tell him that both Suniti and Surichi are his mothers, and they both love him very much? Then, why was Surichi always nasty to him?
- Why is there so much bitterness between his mother and his stepmother?
- Why didn’t Surichi let him sit on his father’s lap?
- Why did his father not do anything when his stepmother pushed Dhruva away from the king? Isn’t he the king and the most powerful person in the kingdom? Why did he seem helpless in that situation?
- Why did his mother say that he will understand all this when he grows up? Why couldn’t he get the answers now?

Dhruva then thinks, maybe if he searches for this Vishnu that his mother and stepmother spoke of, he will get the answers to his questions. He then resolves to follow Suniti’s words and head to the wilderness the next day, perform severe penance and meditate with complete focus on Vishnu.

The story goes that, Dhruva on his way to the forest, meets Sage Narada, and with Sage Narada’s guidance, he successfully finishes his penance, meets the god Vishnu, realizes the truth, and gleans answers to his questions. He returns from his penance full of wisdom and grows up to be a just king. After his death, he ascends to the heavens and becomes the Pole Star, also called Dhruva Nakshatra, to symbolize his living self’s wise and unwavering nature.
