# Financial Incentives and Work Efficiency

I was recently going through this ICML 2013 Workshop paper ( [Financial Incentives and Efficiency of Crowdsourced Work](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI13/paper/viewFile/6301/6887) ) by Yiling Chen, it was quite interesting.

I think the gist of it was that offering a high initial reward(compared to a lower initial reward) for a task is not likely to increase the quality of the work done. But on the contrary, starting with a lower initial reward and then increasing the reward for similar and consecutive tasks is likely to see a substantial increase in the quality of work from the workers. They carried out the experiments on Amazon MTurk.

In other words, an organization would be wiser if they hired new employees at a lower initial wage and then gave them a pay hike in the first year, rather than offer a high initial package and not offer a pay hike in the initial few years.

Now, this might seem obvious to some people, it does to me too, but apparently, this is not how some of the major organizations( IT) seem to think. Check out this conversation I had with a senior executive -

Apparently, the accepted wisdom is that - "smart managers know that it is much easier to hire at a higher wage than it is to hire at a lower wage and give a raise later"

Maybe the HR policies of many organizations are not very optimal?
