If there is one thing I learned in my 20s, it is just how fragile the human ego is. How petty and small-minded people can be and how envy and resentment can rip apart relationships, families, and workplaces.

Toxic situations at workplaces are not very uncommon. Toxicity in workplaces is often the result of a bad team dynamic or certain bad eggs in the team. The leadership and management/bosses can be well-meaning, and the workplace can still be toxic due to certain co-workers. The leadership and management might just fail to read the situation correctly.

Consider this situation – Say there is a new technology disrupting the market. Using and implementing the latest technology requires specialized skills that experienced people from the industry do not possess, but younger people graduating from universities have them. The senior workers see this as a blow to their position and influence in the organizational setup. And their ego is probably getting in the way of accepting the expertise of the younger people. Such workers who want to maintain their power, or are motivated mainly by personal gains like a promotion or pay raise alone, can sometimes use petty and mean-spirited methods to manipulate the situation to hide their shortcomings and put down others.

Such a situation will set the stage for some very nasty partisan politicking. People will get co-opted into different sides, and there will be nasty mud-slinging matches ruining the workplace’s productivity. And from this point on, it will be a complex task for anyone to untangle the mess.

Such situations remind me of this quote by Sir Walter Scott –

This is why it is my belief that it is always best and healthy, at any point in time, to compare only with an earlier version of yourself and see how you are improving and progressing rather than comparing with others and feeling resentful. Each man’s path is different. Success and failures, positives and negatives, come in different ways and at different times for each person. Resenting the skill or success of others and trying to pull them down when things may not be going well for you is a very deplorable thing. Sadly many of our fellow humans indulge in this all the time.

The above situation I narrated is just one example. Similar situations can arise outside workplaces, in schools or in families, between brothers and sisters, or a husband unable to come to terms with the progress of his wife’s career while his own career may be stagnating due to other reasons. Ego and envy are deadly beasts to slay.

### On a related note – 

why do certain products from big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, fail despite hiring top tech talent? The following is a very accurate take on the matter. I have seen this happen with certain products –

### A Tangential Story -

In the above context, a tangentially related story that comes to mind is the story of Arjuna and Karna from Mahabharata. Their rivalry is very famous and lasts for almost all their lifetimes. Arjuna is always focused on bettering himself and becoming the best possible archer. Whereas Karna is forever obsessed with Arjuna and how he could beat or better Arjuna in a duel. In my opinion, this is the defining difference between the two warriors – their attitude to their craft and life.

This is also the reason why Arjuna eventually emerges victorious. Alternate versions of the story paint Karna as the more skillful warrior who was wronged by the society he was born into. It is tempting to paint the underdog as the hero who was wronged, but I do not buy those versions. No doubt Karna had a hard life and faced prejudice and discrimination, but it does not necessarily make him a better archer.

Every time Karna and Arjuna face off( as per the story in the critical editions published by The Bhandarkar Oriental Institute), Karna comes worse off –

- In the gurudakshina war against Drupada fought on behalf of Drona, Karna loses, but Arjuna wins.
- In the Virat yudha, Arjuna single-handedly defeated Karna and all the other Kaurava warriors.
- In the final war, Arjuna again wins over Karna.

Arjuna wanted to become a better archer; Karna just wanted to best Arjuna. The sympathy that Karna usually gets from the public is, in my opinion, not wholly justified. He had plenty of chances to do the right thing; he never took them.
