Toxic situations at workplaces are not very uncommon. Toxicity in workplaces is often the result of a bad team dynamic or certain bad eggs in the team. The leadership and management/bosses can be well-meaning, and the workplace can still be toxic due to certain co-workers. The leadership and management might just fail to read the situation correctly.

Consider this situation – Say there is a new technology disrupting the market. Using and implementing the latest technology requires specialized skills that experienced people from the industry do not possess, but younger people graduating from universities have them. The senior workers see this as a blow to their position and influence in the organizational setup. And their ego is probably getting in the way of accepting the expertise of the younger people. Such workers who want to maintain their power, or are motivated mainly by personal gains like a promotion or pay raise alone, can sometimes use petty and mean-spirited methods to manipulate the situation to hide their shortcomings and put down others.

Such a situation will set the stage for some very nasty partisan politicking. People will get co-opted into different sides, and there will be nasty mud-slinging matches ruining the workplace’s productivity. And from this point on, it will be a complex task for anyone to untangle the mess.

Such situations remind me of this quote by Sir Walter Scott –

This is why it is my belief that it is always best and healthy, at any point in time, to compare only with an earlier version of yourself and see how you are improving and progressing rather than comparing with others and feeling resentful. Each man’s path is different. Success and failures, positives and negatives, come in different ways and at different times for each person. Resenting the skill or success of others and trying to pull them down when things may not be going well for you is a very deplorable thing. Sadly many of our fellow humans indulge in this all the time.

The above situation I narrated is just one example. Similar situations can arise outside workplaces, in schools or in families. Some recent events I witnessed made me reflect on this - Ego and envy are deadly beasts to slay.

### On a related note – 

why do certain products from big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, fail despite hiring top tech talent? The following is a very accurate take on the matter. I have seen this happen with certain products –
