Once there was supposed to be a running race conducted between Ramu and Raju to decide who is the better runner.

Ramu was unsure of his own skill as a runner and he feared losing the race. So, the night before the race day he secretly went to Raju’s room, tied him up, and cut off his legs. Everyone, except Raju, thought this was an unfortunate accident on Raju’s part.

On race day, Ramu easily won the race and to appear gracious he offered to buy Raju a fancy wheelchair with the prize money. If Raju rejects the offer, he comes across as bitter and ungrateful, if he takes the offer he will end up showing Ramu as generous and large-hearted. In either case, Raju will be unable to run races.
