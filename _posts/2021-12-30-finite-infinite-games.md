This was a very weird book to read; it reads like a series of maxims, quotes, and aphorisms. A lot of it might not make sense right away, but parts of it gradually make sense over time.

But I find the core idea of the book pretty appealing, and here is what I take away from the book –

- Finite games are played to win the game, and Infinite games are played to continue the play.
- Most people play the first kind of game, but playing the second kind of game is far more fun.
- **Example of playing an infinite game** – Pursue a deep passion for a subject or a craft in your life. Such a pursuit leads one to develop deep specific knowledge about those areas of human endeavor. The benefit of playing the infinite game is that deep specific knowledge combined with leverage that one may acquire over the course of one’s life is a sure-shot way to lead a more fulfilling life. And this is what the book recommends.
- Playing an infinite game is about moving in a direction that is tangential to the win/loss logic of whatever finite game we might be currently caught up in.
- Playing such infinite games is not a cop-out but rather a realization that life is more than whatever finite game we might currently be engaged in.

This advice to play the infinite game instead of getting tied up in a particular finite game has parallels to the concept of निष्काम कर्म. The book describes the same concept but uses a very different vocabulary.

I usually finish a non-fiction book feeling that it could have been shorter and more concise; it was the exact opposite for this book. As I said, it reads like a series of aphorisms, and it would have been good if the author could elaborate and explain some of them. But all the heavy lifting and understanding is left to the reader; there is no handholding.
