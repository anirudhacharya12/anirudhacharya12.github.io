Once, an election was conducted in a constituency, mostly dotted with low-income households and a factory nearby. A local politician took a kickback from the factory owner; he used part of that money to buy several television sets, refrigerators, and washing machines and pocketed the rest. He distributed the purchased electronic goods free of cost among the households in return for their assurance that the residents would vote for him in the coming elections. The constituents took the free goodies and did as asked by him.

Once the election was over, the politician used his control over the state electricity board to cut the electricity supply to the residents and directed all the electricity to the nearby factory at very low rates. This more than compensated the factory owner for the kickback he had given to the politician before the elections. The residents were now stuck with electronic goods, without any electricity. The politician and the factory owner profited at the expense of the naive citizens. A nation of sheep begets a government of wolves.
