This is a story I read as a child about mental conditioning â€“

There was once an elephant calf that was captured to be raised in captivity. The calf was tied to a stout and strong chain, and the other end of the chain was tied to a peg which was driven into the ground. Every time the calf tried to walk away, it was restrained by the chain and got pulled back. Over time as the calf grew up, it learned to not try and move away at all. After many years, the chain was unfastened from the peg, so there was nothing to hold back the elephant( which was now fully grown and quite strong) from walking away, but the mere sight of the chain tied to its leg had conditioned the elephant to not try and move.
