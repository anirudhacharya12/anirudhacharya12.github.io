      <p>I am a Software Developer, currently taking up freelance and contract work.</p>

      <p>In the past I have worked in - Amazon Web Services, Yahoo! and Oracle. I have worked in different verticals like AdTech/Monetization systems, Backend Systems and Webservices for large-scale Consumer facing products, and in building Frameworks and Tools for Machine Learning workflows.</p>

      <p>I did my undergrad in NITK Surathkal and have a Masters in Computer Science from Arizona State University.</p>

      <p>Outside work, I am interested in fitness and I am learning Yoga, and I occasionally enjoy playing cue and racquet sports. I used to blog on this <a href="https://anirudhblog45.wordpress.com/about/">WordPress blog</a> from my undergrad days and still sometimes use it as a scrapbook.</p>

      <p>During my first few years in California, cycling in around the Bay Area used to be my usual weekend getaway. I had initially thought I would write a <a href="https://travel-anirudhacharya.blogspot.com/">travel blog</a> about these weekend cycling jaunts, but I eventually settled to making a map marking the different bike trails I had been to.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:1cm;">Prior to coming to the United States, I spent time in Surathkal, Mangalore and worked for a couple of years in Hyderabad. These are most of the places I have visited in India during that time.</p>
