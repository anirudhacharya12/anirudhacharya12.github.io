### A Tangential Story -

In the above context, a tangentially related story that comes to mind is the story of Arjuna and Karna from Mahabharata. Their rivalry is very famous and lasts for almost all their lifetimes. Arjuna is always focused on bettering himself and becoming the best possible archer. Whereas Karna is forever obsessed with Arjuna and how he could beat or better Arjuna in a duel. In my opinion, this is the defining difference between the two warriors – their attitude to their craft and life.

This is also the reason why Arjuna eventually emerges victorious. Alternate versions of the story paint Karna as the more skillful warrior who was wronged by the society he was born into. It is tempting to paint the underdog as the hero who was wronged, but I do not buy those versions. No doubt Karna had a hard life and faced prejudice and discrimination, but it does not necessarily make him a better archer.

Every time Karna and Arjuna face off( as per the story in the critical editions published by The Bhandarkar Oriental Institute), Karna comes worse off –

- In the gurudakshina war against Drupada fought on behalf of Drona, Karna loses, but Arjuna wins.
- In the Virat yudha, Arjuna single-handedly defeated Karna and all the other Kaurava warriors.
- In the final war, Arjuna again wins over Karna.

Arjuna wanted to become a better archer; Karna just wanted to best Arjuna. The sympathy that Karna usually gets from the public is, in my opinion, not wholly justified. He had plenty of chances to do the right thing; he never took them.
